Instructions for using Neural Network Program

1. Download program
2. Open python file with IDE
3. Run program and input neural network parameters (Default: 784, 30, 10) then trainingsetX, training setY, testingsetX filenames. Training and testing sets are not included
therefore the user will need to download them into the directory that the python file is contained in. 
4. Cross entropy function can be enabled by modifying the boolean value in the python file at line 6, "quadratic" to False to enable the cross entropy function. It
is set to true by default, enabling the quadratic function by default.
